Run "make" to build the capi source code.

Organised like this:

share/
    make_capi.pl -> Reads llvm-c header files and generates D code and
                    forwarding functions wrapping things like strings
gen/ (generated directory)
    core.d   -> bustin.gen.core = generated mixins for OO style API
    capi/ (generated subdirectory)
        core.d       -> bustin.gen.capi.core  = generated core.d from llvm-c/Core.h
capi/
    core.d       -> bustin.capi.core  = public imports gen.core + add
core.d           -> bustin.core       = OO API, classes inherit generated mixins

Also supports modules "execution_engine" and "target" as per core.
